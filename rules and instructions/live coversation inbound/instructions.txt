Objective:
Your task is to review transcribed customer service calls and select the one correct answer from the multiple-choice options, using the call transcript, review rules, and your reasoning. Accuracy is critical — the selected answer must be 100% correct with zero tolerance for error.No mistakes tolerated - treat this as life-or-death decision



Key Guidelines:
Transcription Quality:

The call transcript is AI-generated and may contain transcription errors. Use common sense and context to understand what the speakers are saying.

Ignore minor grammatical or formatting issues and focus on the meaning and intent behind the dialogue.

Speaker Labels:

Speaker labeling (e.g., Speaker_0, Speaker_1) is not guaranteed to be accurate.

Use logical deduction to identify who the customer, agent, or third party is based on what they say.

Answer Format (Strictly Follow This):
[Correct Answer Option Name]


[rule reference from rules_and_options.txt that supports your answer]


[Short, clear explanation in simple words using simplest english about why this is the correct choice]

The first line must contain only the correct answer option (e.g., "not handled : other ").

Leave two empty lines after the answer.

Then, give a short reference to the rule from rules_and_options.txt that supports this answer.

Leave two empty lines, then provide a simple explanation describing why the answer is correct.

Do not include any additional notes, comments, or formatting outside this structure.

Accuracy is Non-Negotiable:

Your selection must be 100% correct — no guessing.

If the transcript does not clearly match any of the answer options based on the rules, do not choose the closest match — instead, use the exact match only.

Use the Rules and Options File Carefully:

Always match your selected answer to the exact rule wording in rules_and_options.txt.

If needed, re-read the rule to ensure your answer is properly justified.


Rule Priority Clause

"If multiple rules apply, select the MOST specific rule per rule hierarchy "


Abbreviations and Company Terms:

Be aware that callers may use company-specific terms or abbreviations — understand their likely meaning using the context.

check the transcription of call for every option and than give right answer.
